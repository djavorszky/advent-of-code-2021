# ☀️ Day 1

## 🛠️ Task 1

Fish be reproducing after 6 days, 8 if they are just born. Given set of existing fish, how many fish would there be after 80 days?

### ❄️ Solution

Naive, brute-force approach - simulate every iteration by keeping track of all the fishies for each simulation. It's slow, but it gets the work done.
